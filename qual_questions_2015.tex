\title{2015 ``Will Ask'' Qual Questions}

\section*{Radiative Processes}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Derive the total power and characteristic frequency 
      of synchrotron radiation from a relativistic particle of mass $m$, 
      charge $e$, and energy $E$ moving in a magnetic field $B$. 
      Use this to explain why synchrotron radiation is generally 
      negligible for protons.}

The total power is

\begin{equation}
  P = \frac{4}{3} \, \sigma_T \, c \, \gamma^2 \, \beta^2 \, u_B
  \label{eq:relativistic-larmor}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_T$ is the Thomson cross section $\frac{8}{3} \pi r_0^2$,
$u_B$ is the magnetic energy density $\frac{B}{8 \pi}$.

The characteristic frequency of gyration is

\begin{equation}
\omega_g = \frac{eB}{\gamma mc}
\end{equation}

To derive this, begin with the equation of motion resulting from the Lorentz force:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} (\gamma m \vel) = \frac{e}{c} \, (\vel \times \mathbf{B})
  \label{eq:lorentz-force}
\end{equation}

For a particle with constant energy $E = \gamma m c^2$,
we can take $\gamma$ to be constant.
Therefore, Equation \ref{eq:lorentz-force} can be rewritten

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d \vel}{dt} = \frac{e}{\gamma m c} \, (\vel \times \mathbf{B})
  \label{eq:lorentz-force-rearranged}
\end{equation}

Because of the cross product in Equation \ref{eq:lorentz-force-rearranged}, the magnetic field only changes the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to it. Thus, Equation \ref{eq:lorentz-force-rearranged} can be rewritten

\begin{equation}
  \acc = \frac{d \vel_\bot}{dt} = \frac{e}{\gamma m c} \, (\vel_\bot \times \mathbf{B})
  \label{eq:lorentz-force-perp}
\end{equation}

Because $\vel_\parallel$ and $\vel_\mathrm{tot}$ are constant,
$\vel_\bot$ must be constant as well. Assuming an unchanging magnetic field, the acceleration in Equation \ref{eq:lorentz-force-perp} is constant. We thus have uniform circular motion in the ($\vel_\bot$, \bfield) plane. Together with the constant velocity normal to this plane, we have helical motion.

Because the motion is circular, the acceleration in Equation \ref{eq:lorentz-force-perp} can be taken to be a centripetal acceleration
with magnitude

\begin{equation}
a = v_\bot \omega_g = \frac{e v_\bot B}{\gamma m c}
\label{eq:acc}
\end{equation}

So, the corresponding characteristic frequency of rotation is

\begin{equation}
\omega_g = \frac{e B}{\gamma m c}
\end{equation}

To calculate the power, we use the \textbf{relativistic Larmor formula}
which gives the power radiated by a particle moving at relativistic speeds. It is derived via Lorentz transformations, taking the non-relativistic Larmor formula to hold true in the frame of the particle.
We use only one term of it, since the acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity.

\begin{equation}
  P = \frac{2}{3} \frac{\gamma^4 e^2 a^2}{c^3}
  \label{rel-larmor-formula}
\end{equation}

Now we plug in our expression for acceleration in Equation \ref{eq:acc} and average the formula over all angles (assuming an isotropic distribution of velocities). If $\alpha$ is the angle between the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field, 

\begin{equation}
\langle v_\bot^2 \rangle = \frac{v^2}{4 \pi} \int \sin^2 \alpha \, d\Omega
= \frac{2}{3} v^2
\end{equation}

With this averaging and some substitutions,

\begin{equation}
  P = \frac{4}{3} \, \sigma_T \, c \, \gamma^2 \, \beta_\bot^2 \, u_B
  \label{relativistic-larmor}
\end{equation}

The timescale on which power is lost due to sycnchrotron radiation
is about $\frac{E}{dE/dt}$. Since $E \sim \gamma m_0 c^2$ and
$ P = dE/dt$, we find that the timescale scales as $\gamma$. 
$\gamma$ itself scales as $E/E_0$ where $E_0$ is the rest mass energy
of the particle. This is roughly 0.511\,MeV for an electron and 938\,MeV
for a proton. So, for a given energy, the timescale is much longer
for a proton than it is for an electron.

Also, note that $\omega_g$ is not actually the frequency of radiation.
In practice, the frequency spectrum is complex and can extend up to many times $\omega_g$. Important effects include: 

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Broad spectrum due to relativistic beaming: the particle's radiation is beamed within $1/\gamma$ of a cone with half-angle equal to the pitch angle. This cone is the characteristic angular distribution of radiation emitted by a particle with perpendicular acceleration and velocity. Thus, instead of a sinusoidal light curve, you get a series of sharp pulses. Recall that the Fourier Transform of a short time pulse is a broad frequency spectrum with $\Delta \omega \sim 1/T$.

\item
The time between pulses is a factor of $\gamma^3$ narrower than what you'd get from $\omega_g$ due to the Doppler effect. 

\item
The single-particle spectrum extends to
something of order $\omega_c$ before falling away,
where $\omega_c \sim \gamma^3 \omega_g$. 

\item
The spectrum of a distribution of a population of relativistic electrons can be approximated by a power law over a limited range of frequencies. For a power law distribution of particle energies with index $p$ (that is, $N(E) dE = C E^{-p} dE$) over a sufficiently broad energy range, the spectral index of the radiation is $s = (p-1) / 2$. 

\end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Explain the connection between detailed balance, 
    the Einstein A and B relations,
    Kirchoffâ€™s law and the Milne relations, 
    and give an example of their use to connect the
    bremsstrahlung emission spectrum and the free-free absorption coefficient.}

I suspect that the key connecting concept here is \emph{thermal radiation}:
radiation emitted by matter that is in thermal equilibrium.

The Einstein relations link together atomic properties and
thus macroscopic conditions (like thermal equilibrium) don't matter.
Consider a two-level system, the top level characterized by
$L_2, g_2$ and the bottom level characterized by $L_1, g_1$. 
The energy gap is $h\nu$. The different Einstein coefficients
characterize the transition probability per unit time for
three different mechanisms: $A_{21}$ for spontaneous emission
(no radiation field required), $B_{12} \bar{J}$ for absorption,
and $B_{21} \bar{J}$ for stimulated emission.

\begin{equation}
  \bar{J} \equiv \int_0^\infty J_\nu \phi(\nu) d\nu
  \label{jbar}
\end{equation}

Note that the B's are both proportional to the mean intensity
of the radiation field.

The detailed balance equation says that the number of transitions into level 2
equals the number of transitions out of level 2. In other words,
in thermal equilibrium, the number of transitions into an atomic state
equals the number of transitions out of the state. 
It can be written as follows:

\begin{equation}
  n_1 B_{12} \bar{J} = n_2 B_{21} \bar{J} + n_2 A_{21}
  \label{detailed-balance}
\end{equation}

The Boltzmann Equation governing thermal equilibrium is

\begin{equation}
  \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} e^{h \nu / k_B T}
  \label{boltzmann-eq}
\end{equation}

Using this to solve for $\bar{J}$ we get

$$ \bar{J} = \frac{A_{21} / B_{21}}{(g_1 B_{12}/g_2 B_{21}) e^{h\nu/kT} - 1} $$

This is equal to 

$$ B_\nu = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1} $$

This gives the Einstein relations:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2}
  \label{einstein-A}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  g_1 B_{12} = g_2 B_{21}
  \label{einstein-B}
\end{equation}

Notice that the temperature dependence drops,
so the Einstein relations hold even outside of
thermal equilibrium.

\textbf{Kirchoff's law for thermal equilibrium}
describes the emitting and absorbing properties
of a thermally emitting material that is exposed
to blackbody radiation of intensity $B_\nu(T)$.
``Thermally emitting'' means that the material's emission
depends solely on its temperature and internal properties.
More formally, this law is a relationship between
the material's absorption coefficient $\alpha_\nu$,
its emission coefficient $j_\nu$,
and its temperature $T$:2

\begin{equation}
  j_\nu = \alpha_\nu B_\nu (T)
  \label{kirchoff-law}
\end{equation}

This says that a good emitter is a good absorber, in
thermal equilibrium. The moral of the story is that
there is clearly a relationship between emission
and absorption at a microscopic level.
The picture you should have in your head is some
thermally emitting material 
sitting at the opening of a blackbody enclosure. 
The source function of the material $S_\nu$ must equal
the intensity of the blackbody radiation from the
enclosure $B_\nu (T)$. 

The \textbf{Milne Relation} governs the inverse process
of photoionization, that is an ion recapturing an electron
and emitting a photon. Let $\sigma_{fb}$ be the cross-section
for recapture. We assume complete thermal equilibrium
and derive a result that will end up being independent of
thermal equilibrium. 

Thermal equilibrium dictates that the rate of radiative
recombinations must equal the rate of photoionization.

\textbf{Bremsstrahlung}, or \textbf{free-free emission},
involves an electron whizzing by an ion. There is radiation
emitted due to the acceleration of charge in the Coulomb field
of another charge.

Remember, a good emitter is a good absorber. Using Kirchoff's Law,

$$ j_\nu^{ff} = \alpha_\nu^{ff} B_\nu (T) $$

\begin{equation}
  \frac{dW}{dt dV dv} = \epsilon_\nu^{ff} = 4 \pi j_\nu^{ff} 
  = 6.8 \times 10^{-38} T^{-1/2} Z^2 n_e n_i e^{h \nu / kT}
  \bar{g}^{ff} (\nu,T)
  \label{bremsstrahlung}
\end{equation}

But you also have Kirchhoff's Law (thermal); both of these
processes are happening because we're in thermal equilibrium.
$S_\nu = B_\nu$, and $j_\nu = \alpha_\nu B_\nu$. 

\begin{equation}
  \alpha_\nu^{ff} = 3.7 \times 10^8 T^{-1/2} Z^2 n_e n_i \nu^{-3}
  (1-e^{-h\nu/kT}) g^{ff}
\end{equation}

In the Wien limit, you get $\alpha_\nu^{ff} \propto \nu^{-3} T_{-1/2}$.
In the RJ limit, you get $\alpha_\nu^{ff} \propto \nu^{-2} T^{-3/2}$.

So, you preferantially absorb low-energy electrons.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{High Energy}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Derive, approximately or exactly up to dimensionless factors, the Bondi accretion rate onto a mass $M$ at rest in a homogeneous medium of density $\rho$ and speed of sound $c_s$. Explain the significance of the Bondi radius.}

Bondi accretion is the spherical accretion of interacting particles. We're in the non-relativistic, steady state limit. 

Begin with the Bernoulli Equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} u^2 + \int \frac{dP}{\rho} - \frac{GM}{r} = e = \mathrm{constant}
\end{equation}

Far away from the black hole, you can neglect the velocity $u$ because it goes as $\frac{1}{r^4}$. Out there, the conserved quantity is just the second two terms. You can write the first in terms of the sound speed:

$$ \int \frac{dP}{\rho} = \frac{1}{\gamma-1} c_s^2 $$

since $c_s^2 = \frac{\gamma P}{\rho}$. 

Thus, we have the conservation statement

$$ \frac{1}{\gamma-1} c_s^2 - \frac{GM}{r} = \frac{1}{\gamma-1} c_{s,\infty}^2 $$

The Bondi radius is where the sound speed has changed by order unity from its original value. It defines the radius of influence of the black hole. And, it marks the transition from subsonic (far from the BH) to supersonic (close to the BH). 

At supersonic speeds, 

\begin{equation}
r_\mathrm{Bondi} = \frac{GM}{c^2_\infty}
\end{equation}

At this transition point, the mass accretion rate is governed by conservation of mass:

$$ \dot{M} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho u = 4 \pi \rho u \left(\frac{GM}{c^2_\infty}\right)^2 $$

With some fudge factor $\lambda$,

\begin{equation}
\dot{M} = \lambda 4 \pi \left(\frac{GM}{c^2_\infty}\right)^2 \rho_\infty c_\infty
\end{equation}

\item \textbf{Discuss the difference between high-mass X-ray binaries and low mass X-ray binaries (both containing neutron stars). What are the typical spin period and magnetic fields of the neutron stars in the two types of system, and how are these measured or estimated? How are the spin period and magnetic fields changing with time?}

In many X-ray binary systems, the spin period is observed to be decreasing steadily on a timescale of around 10,000 years. Presumably, this is caused by torques induced by the accretion process. Observed spin periods are usually between 1 second and 1000 seconds. 

Observe LMXB (accretion from Roche lobe overflow, orbital period hours) with coherent X-ray pulsing. The X-ray pulsing continues even when the X-ray intensity drops by large factors. Surface magnetic field of around $10^9$\,G, far lower than the fields inferred in pulsing sources in HMXB (accretion from the stellar wind of a massive (O or B) star, orbital period $\sim$months, $B \sim 10^{12}$\,G). May suggest that the fields decay, perhaps as a result of accretion. You can also measure weak magnetic fields from quasi-periodic oscillations detected in the power spectra of LMXBs. Spin period on the order of milliseconds. These are the progenitors of the majority of millisecond pulsars. 

HMXB systems emit x-ray pulsations, LMXB systems emit x-ray bursts.

\item \textbf{Derive the equation for the effective temperature of an
accretion disk around a black hole of mass $M$ with accretion rate
$M_\odot$ as a function of radius $r$. Specify the assumptions
required to get an answer, and comment on what could go wrong with them.
Define the Eddington luminosity and explain its relevance to the peak
frequency of the emitted radiation.}

Consider a fully ionized gas and assume it's unmagnetized. There's some flux coming in and on average, photons come out perpendicular. The Thompson cross section is

\begin{equation}
\sigma_T = \frac{8 \pi}{3} \left( \frac{e^2}{m_e c^2} \right)^2
\end{equation}

So the radiation force is

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Force} = \sigma_T \frac{F}{c}
\end{equation}

Now, assume that for each electron, radiation force balances gravity ($m_e g$) and solve for the luminosity limit for keeping electrons bound:

$$ L_e < \frac{4 \pi G M m_e c}{\sigma_T} = 7 \times 10^{34} \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right) \, \mathrm{erg/s}$$

There are lots of stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars that have much higher luminosity than this. The mistake is that we assumed that only the gravitational force was acting, but there's also a (stronger) electric force:

$$ \frac{e Q}{r} > \frac{G M m_e} {r^2} $$

When this is the case, you can estimate the \emph{fraction} of electrons that are lost by the number of electrons lost over the total number of electrons: $\frac{Q/e}{M/m_p}$. You can write this in terms of the ratio of proton mass to electron mass and the fine structure constant. When you do, you find that the number is \emph{tiny}: the moral is that there aren't that many electrons to be lost. 

Instead of individual electrons, let's consider ions: you have to remove an entire ion with its electrons in order to unbind. The balance between gravitational force and radiation force becomes

$$ M_{\mathrm{ion}} g = F_{\mathrm{rad, ion}} $$

Since the electron mass is negligible compared to the proton mass, $M_{\mathrm{ion}} \sim A m_u$. $F_{\mathrm{rad, ion}}$ is just the sum of the radiation force on each electron, so $F_{\mathrm{rad, ion}} = Z F_{\mathrm{rad, e}}$. The maximum luminosity the star can have without losing ions to radiation is therefore: 

$$ A m_u \frac{GM}{r^2} > \frac{L}{4 \pi r^2 c} Z \sigma_T $$

This gives us our definition of the \textbf{Eddington luminosity}:

\begin{equation}
\ledd \equiv \frac{4 \pi G M c}{Z \sigma_T / A m_u} = \frac{4 \pi G M c}{\sigma_T (1 + X) / (2 m_u)}
\end{equation}

where $X$ is the hydrogen mass fraction. 

To estimate a numerical value for this, put it in terms of the $L_e$ that we solved for earlier, and the $m_p/m_e$ ratio. This gives:

$$ \ledd = 1.3 \times 10^{38} \frac{2}{1+X} \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right) \mathrm{erg/s} $$

This could be violated under the following circumstances:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Different opacity: dust or photoionization (this is why red giants have enormous dusty winds) or strong magnetic fields (quantum electrodynamic effects).
\item Electrons are actually not bound; instead, they're flowing out due to a wind (radiation convection).
\end{enumerate}

When you accrete, you basically drop stuff onto a hard surface. The energy released is the change in potential energy $ \frac{G M \dot{M} }{R} $. In order to accrete, you must be radiating below $\ledd$; otherwise, the effective gravity would be in the other direction. So, $\ledd$ sets the maximum luminosity above which the object can no longer accrete. This therefore corresponds to a maximum mass accretion rate:

\begin{equation}
\medd \equiv \frac{4 \pi c R}{\sigma_T (1 + X) / 2 m_u}
\end{equation}

Numerically,

$$ \medd = 1.5 \times 10^{-8} \, \frac{M_\odot}{\mathrm{yr}} \left( \frac{R}{10\,\mathrm{km}} \right) \left( \frac{2}{1+X} \right) $$

\textcolor{red}{In short, radiation pressure on electrons balances with gravity on nuclei. $\mathrm{Force}=\mathrm{Flux} \times \bar{Z}\sigma_{T}/c=GM \bar{A}m_u/r^2$. For disk accretion, radiation is not necessarily to be isotropic. }

\end{enumerate}
